RQ: Is there an association between higher reported screentimes and a prevalence of ADHD in children? 

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders among the global population (Faraone et al., 2003). While some evidence has suggested increased gray matter in the left superior frontal gyrus and the corpus callosum (Yu et al., 2023), others propose that the condition is caused by increased activity in several subcortical areas, and the frontal cortex (Norman et al., 2024). In addition to its current status as one of the leading neurodevelopmental disorders among the American youth population, ADHD diagnoses have almost doubled in the last 20 years, with male children (age 5-17) maintaining significantly higher diagnosis rates than their female counterparts (U.S. EPA). Children who are diagnosed with ADHD have a larger susceptibility to being affected in academic performance and other domains in functioning (Zhou et al., 2023). Furthermore, a childâ€™s screen time has become a question that families have trouble navigating (Stiglic et al., 2018). In a society where technology is becoming more integrated in daily tasks, there might be implications for how screen time may be a factor in ADHD (Zhou et al., 2023).
